        <p>
            I still remember our first every chess game, and our first ever conversation.
            I find it cute that you even have a crush on me for so long.
        </p>

        <p>
            We’ve had stupid misunderstandings, silent nights,
            and days where both of us were tired of texting,
            but I never got tired of you.
        </p>

        <p>
            You became a part of my daily life now and my life will be incomplete without
            you. I will always put all my efforts in you no matter how bad our days are.
        </p>
